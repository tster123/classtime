# Problem description
The `Parrot` class represents a parrot with an age in years and the ability to learn sounds which it can repeat back when asked to speak. The declaration of the Parrot class is shown below.
```
public class Parrot
{

 /** Constructs a new Parrot object */
 public Parrot(String name)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }

 /** @return the age of the parrot in years */
 public int getAge()
 { /* implementation not shown */ }

 /** Adds sound to the list of sounds the parrot can make
 *  @param sound the sound to add */
 public void train(String sound)
 { /* implementation not shown */ }

 /** @return a random sound that the parrot can make */
 public String speak()
 { /* implementation not shown */ }

 // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```
A pirate parrot is a type of parrot. A pirate parrot knows how to make the sound “Polly want a cracker” immediately upon birth. 
A pirate parrot can also steal souls whose age becomes part of the pirate parrot’s age. 
A pirate parrot is represented by the `PirateParrot` class, which you will write.

Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than `PirateParrot`. The code segment shows an example of using the `PirateParrot` class.
```
PirateParrot polly = new PirateParrot("Polly");

System.out.println(polly.getAge()); // prints 0
/* code to increase Polly's age by 5 years */
System.out.println(polly.getAge()); // prints 5

polly.stealSoul(5);
polly.stealSoul(10);
System.out.println(polly.getAge()); // prints 20

polly.train("Walk the plank");
polly.train("Off with his head");

// Polly retires from his life as a pirate to a cushy life as a pet

Parrot myPetPolly = polly;
System.out.println(myPetPolly.getAge()); // prints 20
myPetPolly.train("Time for bed");
System.out.println(myPetPolly.speak());
/* prints one of the following, chosen at random:
 * Polly want a cracker
 * Walk the plank
 * Off with his head
 * Time for bed
 */
 ```
 
 Write the PirateParrot class. Your code must produce the indicated results when invoked by the code given above.
